I am interested in projects having to do with music, art, or language learning. I am intersted in all of these areas. Looking at projects that deal with these areas, a lot of their UI's are either outdated or hard to use. I like designing these and feel like this would be a fun problem to solve. As for if I ever created my own project in one of these areas, I would most likely organize it as a common repository. If I created an Open Source project, I would want it to be accessable and easy to get to for as many people as possible.
